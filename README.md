# C# FORM PUZZLE GAME

â€¢ The goal of this project is to design a puzzle game. Our puzzle game starts by dividing the uploaded image into 16 equal pieces. While the pieces are being shuffled, if a piece is placed in the correct position, the shuffle button becomes inactive. When solving the puzzle, once a piece is placed in the correct position, the piece is locked and cannot be moved.

# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Initially, we decided to develop this game using C# and opted for Visual Programming. As we know, Windows Forms is an ideal platform for this purpose, supporting a variety of application development features like controls, graphics, data binding, and user input. Using Visual Studio 2022, we leveraged the provided visual designer to create a desktop game. Typically, drag-and-drop functionalities make it easier to create desktop applications with visual controls.

# PROJECT SETUP AND EXECUTION
We made the project operational using Windows Forms and then easily uploaded it to GitHub, thanks to the features provided by Visual Studio. One of the key elements was coding the dashboard background in the form using the C# programming language.
